NEVER scan random QR codes. You do not know where the QR code can lead you to.<br>
People may steal your data or install malware on your device.<br>
Don't worry, this one was harmless, no damage to any devices, and no data was taken.<br>
Never scan unfamilar QR codes and never click on unfamiliar links.</body>
